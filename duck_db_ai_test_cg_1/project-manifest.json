# Concept

This light build turns the full revenue-leak idea into a single-pass diagnostic slice.

## Objective

Find the traffic and landing-page segments that are hurting commercial performance, using only the safest and most direct path from:

- session
- first page viewed
- order outcome
- refund outcome

## Final outputs

- `mart__core_leak_summary`
  - monthly segment summary
  - sessions
  - orders
  - conversion rate
  - gross revenue
  - net revenue
  - revenue per session
  - refund value share

- `mart__priority_actions`
  - ranked segments to investigate first
  - severity score
  - recommended action
  - confidence level

## Why this is the right fallback

It keeps enough of the original business idea to be useful, while removing the parts most likely to cause generation drift or lineage errors.
